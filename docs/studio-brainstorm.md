## Additional Notes
*Include any other ideas, inspirations, or thoughts related to your studio or project.*

> [Not sure whether to do a card or board game yet. It would be interesting to make a card game with visual novel/story elements. Maybe different ways you play change your relationships with characters and areas. Or maybe a game where “losing” is how you “win”. I still have a lot to think about.]
