#### Goals for this Module

- [X] Learn the basics of what makes a game a game
- [X] Get started with brainstorming my game
- [X] Think of themes/aesthetics for my game/studio


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:

  I was able to start thinking of how I’d want my game and studio to look and feel. I learned about elements of gameplay. I also got to discuss different games and what aspects added/took away from them.
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  N/A
- **Solutions**:
  -  N/A

#### Learnings

-  Basics of what defines a video game, examples of good and bad mechanics in games, ways games have prioritized fancy graphics instead of gameplay.

#### Free Thinking
-  I just did the Global Game Jam and it definitely helped me test out some ideas and learn more about coding and aesthetics in a game. I still don’t know if I want to make purely a card game or more of a board game.A board game might be more technically complicated but with a card game I might have to rely on simpler mechanics, (which means I need to make sure those are fun).
