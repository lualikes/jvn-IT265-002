-  <!--Basics of what defines a video game, examples of good and bad mechanics in games, ways games have prioritized fancy graphics instead of gameplay.-->

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  <!--I just did the Global Game Jam and it definitely helped me test out some ideas and learn more about coding and aesthetics in a game. I still don’t know if I want to make purely a card game or more of a board game.A board game might be more technically complicated but with a card game I might have to rely on simpler mechanics, (which means I need to make sure those are fun). -->
