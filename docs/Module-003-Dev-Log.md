#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  In this module we learned about the look and feel of a game which is one of my favorite parts. I saw how different color combinations can create different emotions to help with visual storytelling.
#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  The art is probably what I'm most excited to make for my game because it's what I have the most experience with. I want to focus on either red or lavendar hues throughtout the entire game. I want to experiment with colorful lighting and try to use light to focus on certain parts of the game, like we learned about.

#### Next Steps
-  1. Do some basic concept art.
   2. Look at different color palettes.
   3. Become familiar with Godot for the future.
