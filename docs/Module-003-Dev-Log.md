#### Goals for this Module

- [X] Brainstorm more ideas for the game
- [X] Think about aesthetics and atmosphere
- [ ] List ideas and do sketches of the visuals


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - This module I got to think a lot more about the visuals of the game which was interesting. I thought about how I want to build off of my game jam game's artstyles to create a new style for this prototype. I learned about increasing player immersion in a game through design and thought about how to apply that to my own ideas.

- **Challenges faced**:
  - N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - N/A

#### Learnings
-  In this module we learned about the look and feel of a game which is one of my favorite parts. I saw how different color combinations can create different emotions to help with visual storytelling. I want to use this to build the story of my game but I feel like I won't have much time to include everything I want story-wise in the class prototype. We also talked about good examples of UI that are integrated into the game and don't take you out of the experience. Using animation to convey touch with heavy items was also a cool concept.
#### Free Thinking
-  The art is probably what I'm most excited to make for my game because it's what I have the most experience with. I want to focus on either red or lavendar hues as the core colors throughtout the entire game to keep it consistent. I want to experiment with colorful lighting and try to use light to focus on certain parts of the game, like we learned about. I won't be able to do anything with sound because I have no idea how to do music. I want to have a clear UI because that's something I haven't been good at.

#### Next Steps
1. Do some basic concept art.
2. Look at different color palettes.
3. Become familiar with Godot for the future.
