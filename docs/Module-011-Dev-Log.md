#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Take Final
- [X] Get at least a working prototype/demo
- [X] Finish Game Design Document with changes

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I completed a short simple demo of my game, focusing on the card aspects. I got a small version of the board made with a dice roll and attack tiles. I was able to update my Game Design Document with all the changes I made from the physical prototype to the current digital one. 
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  I started running out of time due to having a lot of finals/essays approaching. I couldn't figure out why my deck wouldn't delete cards when you clicked on them. The cards were the hardest part and I kept having issues with them not spawning correctly.
- **Solutions**:
  -  I focused on getting the basic card and board mechanics down and made sure there was a win/lose scenario. I watched tutorials on youtube on deck building in gamemaker. I then created a global variable just for the number of cards and destroyed the instances of cards whilst decreasing the count. 

#### Learnings
-  I learned a lot about using list data structures in engines like GameMaker and how to automate a dice roll instead of having players manually pick spaces. I learned about collisions and how to balance damage and health in a character.

#### Free Thinking
-  I'm sad that I have enough time/skill to include all the features/art I wanted. I'm not very good at programming so I'm happy I was able to at least accomplish some of the goals I had for this project. I think if I practice GameMaker a bit and spend some time making nice pixel art, then I could actually turn this into a little game. I look forward to making nicer art for it and expanding the gameplay loop. 

#### Next Steps
- These are next steps as a personal project outside of this class:
1. Find a better way to generate new hands of cards
2. Fully implement the fishing mini game.
3. Add character dialogue options. 
4. Redesign all sprites and make the art look nice.
