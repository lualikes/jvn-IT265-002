#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Confirm card types and designs.
- [ ] Develop different tiles for the board.
- [X] Begin coding digital demo

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I watched a couple YouTube tutorials, started on the card deck code, fixed some card designs, and planned out the board more.
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  My main challenge this week was not having much time because a lot of assignments/finals are due.
- **Solutions**:
  -  I tried to manage my time better and plan out some tasks for next week.

#### Learnings
-  I learned the different logic you can use in Unity to create tiles for a board and to have cards be placed on a board when you click a specific space. My game also uses cards and a 2D grid, so even though I won't use Unity and I don't need to place cards directly onto the board, certain code about how to make the actual deck will be useful for me to translate Also, looking at an example of a game I like and the mechanics that make it fun will help me make my own mechanics interesting.
#### Free Thinking 
-  I want to incorporate the fishing minigame before class ends but I might have to just focus on the card battles for now. The relationship mechanic/gaining points with allies could be added in the demo if I make it much simpler and you just get extra points or a multiplier in battle with characters that like you. I actually do want to work on this game in the future so hopefully I could make a good basis to work off of in the future.

#### Next Steps
1. Code at least one basic battle.
2. Design and add clear UI.
3. Start figuring out local multiplayer (taking turns).
