#### Goals for this Module

- [X] Start getting feedback on my game ideas
- [X] Begin writing our game mechanics in detail
- [X] Learn about depth/complexity & think about that in my game


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I already know who I will ask for feedback and started asking them if they were willing to help. I copied and pasted some of my notes into my new design treatment doc and started organizing things more. Now I feel more comfortable set in some aspects of my game, even if there are a lot more to go. 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Having way too many ideas and not focusing on the main game mechanics.
- **Solutions**:
  - Starting the design treatment, even though I'm not done, helped me get more organized and cut down extra ideas.

#### Learnings
-  After we talked about randomness and how there's never true randomness in game, I thought about how I want to add that into my game. A board game needs to simulate randomness and translate it to the player through things like dice, so that will be cool to figure out. Thinking about depth vs. complexity reminds me of many games I've played where actions are overly detailed to do but don't feel important. I don't want my game to be too complicated, but I do want it to feel like it's own world.

#### Free Thinking
-  I'm not sure whether to make the allies that give the players buffs human characters or cute animal/creatures. Creatures might be easier to make art for, but this choice decides the atmosphere and visual look of the game. I think I can improve my ideas now that I have the extra features figured out and can focus on the main game.

#### Next Steps
-  Finish design treatment.
-  Work on basic concept sketches to include in treatment.
-  Separate what I want to do, what I think I'll be able to get done in this class, what I can work on after the semester, and what to cut in general.
