#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Write down my game ideas
- [X] Look into color schemes
- [X] Come up with game mechanics and what makes them fun


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I revisited color theory by redesigning BurgerTime Atari’s colors to try and make it look more appealing and increase the harmony. I finally started a list of game mechanic ideas and general concepts to narrow down what I’m doing for this board game. Using what I learned about color harmony and atmosphere, I looked at different color palettes for my game.
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  N/A
- **Solutions**:
  -  N/A

#### Learnings
-  I liked looking at the short game demo in class and thinking about what mechanics could be added that could either increase or decrease the fun of the game. I learned about different strategy and skill-based mechanics and we talked about good vs bad ways of implementing these. Thinking about improving mechanics of games I played also made me understand what makes things fun. I also figured out how many things can be considered a game mechanic.

#### Free Thinking
-  I want players to move across the board but at certain spots they land on, they either get to play a card minigame or meet a character that will give them buffs or curses. Easier characters give less cool buffs but each character has an ultimate buff that you receive when you maxxed their friendship. For the core game mechanic in the minigame, I want to take inspiration from Mahjong and Parcheesi, but I don’t want to clone them. There’s a lot missing because I still don’t know the win/lose conditions or the main gameplay mechanic.


#### Next Steps
1. Sketch the game’s board.
2. Sketch basic character concepts.
3. Get other people’s opinions on the main game mechanics.
