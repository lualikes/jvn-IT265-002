#### Goals for this Module

- [X] Begin detailed design treatment
- [X] Create concept art and share it with other people
- [X] Write game mechanics and listen to detailed feedback 


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I asked a couple different people to read through my treatment so far and they gave pretty helpful feedback. It was most useful to improve the game mechanic ideas I had. Starting to make art and a character design was satisfying and helped me see where the game was going. 

- **Challenges faced**:
  -  I got stuck on what to make the card battle game mechanic because I didn’t want to just copy other games and I didn’t want it to be too complicated. 
- **Solutions**:
  - I really thought about it and wrote down all my ideas, then I asked for feedback on them and chose the best one.

#### Learnings
- I mainly learned how to organize a design treatment based on the examples given. I also learned how to plan for a physical prototype based on what we saw in class. 

#### Free Thinking
- There’s still more I want to do in the card battles but I really don’t want the rules to be more confusing. I also don’t know if the fishing mechanic is too much and distracts from the main game. There’s definitely a lot I won’t be able to finish in this class, so I should focus on only a couple things for the prototype. 


#### Next Steps
1. Edit parts of game based on feedback
2. Cut down certain ideas and fine tune others
3. Create physical prototype of game
