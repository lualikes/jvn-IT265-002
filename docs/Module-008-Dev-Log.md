#### Goals for this Module

- [X] Learn about engines for digital prototypes
- [X] Finalize scope of digital demo
- [X] Create a plan to implement my 2D game and have it playable on browser


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I got to listen to other people's presentations and saw the different ways people were making their games fun and the many strategies for playtesting and improving. I also was able to establish a better scope for my project after looking at some of the different engines game developers use. I started writing a plan on what I want to get done digitally before the end of the semester.
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  N/A
- **Solutions**:
  -  N/A

#### Learnings
-  I learned the difference between using 2D grids and Hexgrids, and how the latter is usually more complicated. I also learned different engines that could be used in 2D and 3D spaces. After watching presentations, Lizeth's game was pretty inspiring because it reminded me of mine but also of something that I would play. 

#### Free Thinking
- Some extra details I was thinking about for my game:
-  Each campaign is called a voyage. 
- You can play multiple games in a voyage, at the end of each you get a certain favor with characters and this info is retained for benefits in the next round.
- Each round the battles get harder.
- Choose different characters to have different outcomes in the same voyage. 

#### Next Steps
- 1. Continue making sprites of player characters and enemies
- 2. Watch tutorials on how to code in Godot 
- 3. Begin coding the prototype and importing assets into the engine.
