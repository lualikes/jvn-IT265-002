#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Figure out how to implement card mechanics in code
- [X] Find Godot documentation and tutorials for card/board games
- [ ] Start adding in sprites 


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I finally confirmed that I will be making the demo in Godot and I found a couple beginner tutorials to start the project. I made a couple of changes to my Game Design Doc in order to edit for a smaller scope. I started sketching some more characters and UI elements to add in.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - N/A

#### Learnings
-  I saw how different tiles could be implemented in a grid for a Mario Party-like board in Unity which could be applied to other engines. I also learned about some of the benefits of using an Entity Component System and some of the logic that's needed for card systems in games. This is helpful because my game's battle involve shuffling a deck and discarding cards, so I need to find a good data structure for this.

#### Free Thinking
-  I have to focus on getting at least the very basic card battles implemented. Fixing what happens after you turn into a vampire, ironing the other game modes, defining the amount of levels/worlds in a playthrough are all things I can do after this class. I don't think I'm going to be able to make all of the art as detailed as I wanted, but as long as I get decent placeholders in this class I think it will be enough to at least show the vibe of the game. I will try to make one board, at least one fishing spot, and at least one battle, but hopefully more.


#### Next Steps
- 1. Make basic attack, defense, and heal card designs digitally.
- 2. Try to start building the board.
- 3. Start coding movement and battles.
