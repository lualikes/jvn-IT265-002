#### Goals for this Module

- [X] Learn more basics of game design and balance
- [X] Think about core ideas for my game 
- [X] Use an old game to learn about what does or does not make something fun


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - This module I started to learn about balancing a game and the symmetries that can be used. I thought about what types of imbalances I want to avoid in my game and what kind of challenges I want to include. I also completed a case study on the atari game BurgerTime, which was interesting because it was fun even though it was very simplistic due to the limited technology of the time. It helped me think about some core mechanics that I could apply to my game.
- **Challenges faced**
  -  N/A
- **Solutions**:
  -  N/A

#### Learnings
-  I learned about what makes a game fun and about common cliches in games to avoid in the one I make. I also learned about intransitive gameplay with the example of rock paper scissors making it easier to understand. We talked about balancing the difficulty of a game without insulting the player’s intelligence with hand-holding mechanics. It’s helpful to see examples of things that make a game worse so you know what not to do. It’s also helpful to look at Atari games and see what makes them fun because they are so simple. 

#### Free Thinking
-  I’ve been thinking about a card game where you battle another player or an npc and need to build relationships with other npcs to gain points and multipliers that will help you in battle. I was also thinking of using a card game like mahjong as the main gameplay or as a minigame because I liked playing that as a kid. It would be fun to take a classic game and put a twist on it just like Balatro, but I don’t want it to be too similar. 


#### Next Steps
1. List some of my ideas so it’s easier to see them and cut them down
2. Come up with aspects to make a game fun
3. Decide between board game or card game
4. Start doing concept art
