#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Design and edit physical board and cards
- [X] Playtest board game version of game
- [X] Finish first draft of Design Treatment 


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I made all the pieces, cards, and board for the game; I found dice and pieces to represent fish. I got to do one short playtest and remake the cards, but need to try again with the new ones. I figured out more of the battle system and got to write out a lot more details in the treatment.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Originally I couldnâ€™t think of things to make my card battles unique so I just made a very straightforward point system. When I tested it the battles were quick but not really fun.
- **Solutions**:
  - I made new cards that have 3 different colors and tried to make a combo system where if you match more than one color then you get multipliers. This makes attacks more satisfying and forces you to be more strategic.

#### Learnings
- I learned to focus more on my mechanics and leave the rest of the visuals for later. After presenting in class I also realized that players should be able to keep the fish a character catches even if that character dies. I got to see what games some other people were making to get inspiration.

#### Free Thinking
-  I realized that it might make more sense for characters that turned into vampires to still be playable afterwards. Maybe there could be a strategy to making your characters into vampires, giving them more strength but lowering your point total at the end of the game. I could make separate skills for characters after they get turned. This might be too complicated for this class though so maybe I could do it after.


#### Next Steps
1. Incorporate feedback into game by making cards do more damage
2. Do more playtests and adjust cards/amount of enemy spaces based on this
3. Make the end goal one combined goal instead of 2 separate ones. 
4. Start layout of digital prototype
